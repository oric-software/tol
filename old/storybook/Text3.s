he king never returned... As€the only child of a woodsman and his€wife, you have
 seen the troubles that the€High Kings absence has brought upon the€weary land.ÿ

The Barbarians€are once again€pressing hard on€the borders, as€bands break€throu
gh to roam€and pillage.€There is internal€Disunity. The€steward tries to€keep a 
semblance€of order and€harmony, but is€unable to command the powers of the High€
King. The great lords keep to their lands€and castles, thinking mainly of their 
own€security, refusing to cooperate. Some€lords, mainly those who guard the€marc
hes, are developing forces of their€own. The use of assassins is becoming€common
 amongst those who desire to€settle their grievances.ÿ
The wizards, the keepers o
f the old€ways, are given to reclusive€contemplation. Their appearances become€m
ore and more unusual as disorder€unfolds. The Archmage, formerly the€confidant o
f the High King, has been€unseen for many€years and is€thought to have€secluded 
himself€within a distant€tower in another€dimension. A new€breed of dark€priests
, ascetic€but practical€devotees to their€rituals, whose€cult resides in€the dis
tant mountain€vales, have begun spreading their faith€steadily throughout the ki
ngdom.ÿ
Life is slowly‚changing in‚Albareth. The‚scattered farms‚are disappearing
‚and the populace‚has begun to‚seek the refuge‚of walled cities‚and the‚protecti
on of‚castles. Only the‚hardy still abide‚in isolation or€small hamlets. Food ha
s become scarce,€craft and commerce are less common.€Trade routes now lye along 
the rivers and€by sea. Travel into the interior is€uncertain and often dangerous
. There is€still sea trade with lands to the south and€north, but dealings with 
the homelands€has ended.ÿ
Your family refused to take refuge€within the city wall
s, but sent you to stay€with a wealthy but childless uncle in the€capital. Erala
n, the emerald city of the€elden conquerors is the very heart ofAlbareth, throu
ghwhich travellersand their storiespass constantly.Recently, newrumours hav
ebegun to fly.Some say a massattack by theBarbarians isimminent and thatth
e wizards andtheir protection€are finally lost. Others speak of strange€message
s received from the High King and€his Archmage, Irial.ÿ
What is certain is that t
he steward has€summoned a Council to gather the€remaining Powers of the kingdom,
 the€Foretelling Stones, whose keeper is the€Wardon of the northern Marches, the
€Tablet of Truth held by the southern€Marcher Lord Heidric, and the Ring of the€
Archmage.€Together, it is€hoped, these€magical€artifacts can€summon back€the Hig
h King€and his€Medallion of€Power, the€spiritual€keystone of€the realm and€the s
ource of€High Kingship.ÿ
Tension€rises as the€Powers and€their Keepers€are slow i
n€arriving.€Well-known€adventurers€are being€summoned to€undertake€risky but€wel
l-paying€missions.€Your uncle has just passed on, and eager€to prove yourself, y
ou decide to seek€adventurous employment and what it will€bring. You set out in 
search of a meeting€place where adventurers might hope to be€recruited. Aided by
 your uncles wealth,€you have been free to choose your own€lifes course and perf
ect your skills.ÿ
The moment hath arrived, in which you€must choose the one who s
halt bear your€fate. Here stand a night of unfailing€courage, a Valkyrie both st
rong and€Beautiful, and a Barbarian of matchless€might. With the joystick and bu
tton,€select the character who shall live in this€world in thy name in TIMES OF 
LORE.ÿ
A childhood of€stern,honest€discipline taught€you well the€ways of a€Knigh
